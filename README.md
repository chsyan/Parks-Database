# National Parks Database
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We created a web interface for the searching and booking of National Parks in Canada. Our tech stack included PHP for interfacing with the MySQL database. For the front end we use HTML and CSS as well as Javascript. Our app provides access to two primary groups: visitors and park management. 

On the visitorsâ€™ side, we included functionality such as requesting cancellation of current reservations, searching/booking reservation of activities through chosen criteria by keyword or national park name, leaving ratings for the parks, and browsing through the attractions and activities that parks have to offer.

Park management is in charge of the updates/insertion/deletion of any data within the park database. They can also process the cancellations sent in by the visitors, as well as collect important data on the popularity of various activities within our parks.
